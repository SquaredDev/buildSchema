Activity: Build a schema for a collection - Pair Programming

Do you have something you are passionate about and collect? Maybe you collect:

Seashells?
Comic books?
Postcards?
Antique doll outfits?
Masks?
Gargoyles?
Maybe you don't collect anything, but know someone who does.

Pick an item either you collect or that you have heard of people collecting. Build a Mongoose schema for this item. Your schema must have:

At least one non-string field
An array
At least one nested object (can be in array)
